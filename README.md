This is the starting skeleton of the ecommerce website. 
The majority of implementation work should be done under `/ecommerce/src/main/java/ztgg/project/ecommerce/ecommerce/` with the API endpoint exposed at `ServerController.java`
To test your end points:
1. Launch your webapp locallly by Control(cmd for mac) + SHIFT + P to open command palette
2. Type `Spring Boot Dashboard: Run...`
3. Use postman to send request to your endpoint. For example, the starting hello world endpoint is exposed at http://localhost:8080 with `GET` method (you could also paste `http://localhost:8080` in your browser for this case given it's a GET).
